Cloud computing technology or cloud computing has evolved and
become the trend of information technology in the business sector. The basis of the cloud
computing is a virtualization technology capable of creating virtual versions of
operating system, data storage or network resources. In the cloud
computing, if the virtual machine is made carelessly regardless
the existing resources, it may cause the virtual data center is not working
well. Therefore the security factor is based on virtual configuration design
machine on the virtual data center infrastructure becomes important to note.
In this research is done testing against some virtual machine
with resource allocation configuation, vCPU and different topologies
implemented in Xenserver 6.5. The research parameters used are
CPU usage and memory usage.
The results of this study indicate that virtual data center
requires CPU and high memory when first run. Based on
the type of resource allocation used by a virtual machine, the allocation of resources
dynamically indicates memory usage and CPU usage
stable. Based on the topology used by the virtual machine obtained that
vitrual machine with 4vCPU and 1 socket topology with 4 cores require
CPU usage is smaller when compared to others.
