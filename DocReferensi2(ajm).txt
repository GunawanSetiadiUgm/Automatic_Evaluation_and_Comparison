DOTA 2 is a game with the genre of Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA). On DOTA 2, players consisting of 10 people divided into two teams. Each player must choose one hero, the character to be played. Each hero has a unique ability, therefore, the player must choose a hero consider to hero that have been or will be selected by a teammate. Composition of the hero in the team will determine the chances of that team to win. The play style of the team also had to be adjusted to the composition of the hero in the team to increase the chance of victory.
Genetic algorithm is an algorithm that adopts the behavior of living things, such as mating and mutation, to solve a problem. Genetic algorithm are well suited to solve optimization problems. The quality of output produced depends on how the problem designed into a well-designed genetic algorithm.
In this research, a genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal compositions of hero based hero role and play style of the team. Optimal condition is assessed by the quality of how the composition of the hero is able to meet the criteria of the desired play style and can be used in DOTA 2 game. Results of Dota Picker test shows that 8 out of 10 hero compositions that produced in the balance play style, 7 of 10 hero compositions that produced in the late game play style, and 10 of 10 hero compositions that produced in the fast push play style meet the test criteria. Tests on DOTA 2 shows that 12 test matches can be won using the hero composition which is the most optimal result produced by the system.
