Cloud computing has evolved and become the trend of information
technology in business sectors. The basic of cloud computing is virtualization
technology which is able to create a virtual version of the operating system, data
storage or network resources. In cloud computing data center is replaced with a
virtual data center, If all virtual machines on the virtual data center made arbitrarily
without notice the existing resources, it can cause failure to the virtual data
center. Therefore, the safety factor based on the configuration design of virtual
machine in the virtual data center infrastructure becomes important to note.
In this research, multiple virtual machine are tested with configurations for
resource allocation, vCPU and different topologies, which are implemented in
XenServer 6.5. Parameters that are used in this research are CPU and memory
usage.
The results of this research indicate that the virtual data center requires CPU
and high memory on the first run. Based on the type of resource allocation that is
used by virtual machine, resource allocation dynamically shows memory and CPU
usage are stable. Based on the topology used by the virtual machine is obtained
that virtual machine with 4vCPU and topology 1 socket with 4 cores require smaller
CPU usage when compared to the others.
