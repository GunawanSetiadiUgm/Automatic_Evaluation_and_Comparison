The need for data center is increasing due to the development of that era
generate a lot of data. Data center development requires use
IP infrastructure to connect. While the IPv4 inventory already
thinning. The solution is to implement a new IP addressing system. IPv6
is the latest IP addressing system that replaces IPv4. With the system
128-bit addressing makes IPv6 can provide much more addressing
much more than IPv4.
In this research will be done in IPv6 implementation in virtual
data center with Xenserver. Implementation using 6to4 tunneling method
which compared with pure IPv4 usage and pure IPv6. For
knowing its performance, testing with parameter throughput, jitter,
packet loss, and latency. In addition, other tests carried out by analyzing
packets that pass through the network.
The results of this study indicate that the implementation of ipv6 on
virtual data center requires at least 4 pieces of virtual machine as
routers and hosts. Judging from network performance, ipv6 scenario throughput results
pure highest than any other scenario, with an average rating of 2791.29
Mbit / s. The jitter value in the IPv6 tunneling scenario is highest than the two
other scenarios, with an average value of 0.0336 ms. Unlike the IPv6 scenario
tunneling, pure IPv6 scenario and pure IPv4 no packet at all
loss. But for latency parameters, IPv6 tunneling scenarios have latency
the largest with an average value of 1,137 ms.
