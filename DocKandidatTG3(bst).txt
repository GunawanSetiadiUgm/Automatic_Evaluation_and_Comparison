The nearest neighbor search algorithm has been widely known to look for similarities of an object against other objects so that its implementation is commonly used in the field of pattern recognition, data mining, image processing, and others. The algorithm is optimized in the k-dimensional tree data structure. This is done by passing a search object that is not possible to produce optimal results thus speeding up the searching process time.
Implementation of an algorithm that runs in parallel and distributed has become the object of research that is in great demand in the last decade. This is done to handle large-scale data. One of the implementation models used in handling large data is MapReduce. However, libraries that can be utilized for the purposes of extracting data using this model have not been widely available. One is the nearest neighbor search algorithm using the k-dimensional tree.
In this research the nearest neighbor search algorithm is developed using k-dimensional trees that run in parallel and distributed using MapReduce model. This program is run on top of the Apache Hadoop framework. This study was conducted by testing 1.7 million query point data on 2888, 4138, and 5439 cluster spatial object data centers in the form of GPS route coordinates as training data. It is run on 1 to 5 machines. The result of this algorithm can run about 400000 ms on 5 machine.
