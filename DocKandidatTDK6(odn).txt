Need for computer use increases with
the increasing development of technology. One of the tools the use of
the computer is a thin-client. With thin-client, we are not required
removing the huge cost to be able to use a computer. Only with the
a simple device and network connections, we've been able to use
the computer. One of the devices can be made as thin-client is
Raspberry Pi.
In this study used Slow-Motion method of Benchmarking for
calculating performance from 2 thin-client operating system on a platform of Raspberry
PI. The main parameter in this test is giving pause or delay on
each operation is performed so that all the requested operation is acceptable
completely by thin-client after processed by the server in the absence of a process
covered by other processes. This research involves testing, i.e., 3 pieces
test the web page to load text performace, web image page load performance, and
video playback performance.
From the test results obtained that the performance at each thinclient
have significant differences. This is caused by
differences on the model protocol used, and the information processing model
the graphics are done by individual thin-client.
