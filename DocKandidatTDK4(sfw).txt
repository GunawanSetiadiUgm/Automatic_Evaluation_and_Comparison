High number of motor vehicle theft security making the effort is always improved. One way that is often done by installing surveillance cameras or cameras of CCTV (closed circuit television). Furthermore, technology IP camera makes pictures from CCTV cameras can be viewed online. But the fixed IP camera surveillance needs help from humans. Therefore it takes human programs that can help keep an eye on static objects automatically.
The program is created by using a background subtraction algorithm and contour detection. The algorithm simply applied, background subtraction background model used is determined by the user, while the contour detection is used regardless of the hierarchy of the object. After that supervision by way of comparing each object detected in each framenya. In the program there are variables that can be configured to assist in detecting objects and detect the loss of objects.
After the program is created, it can be concluded that the program can keep an eye on objects and can issue warnings when object disappears. Different conditions require different variable configuration, and there is no value of the variable that is great for all conditions in doing oversight. In addition the program created is very sensitive to changes in light, because the learning rate is worth 0. This makes the program is not suitable on places exposed to changes in lighting, such as day and night.
