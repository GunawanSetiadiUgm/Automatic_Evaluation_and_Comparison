Generally, Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is done by performing
feature extraction toward data images input. However, feature extraction of an
image is different from one to another, thus to analyze the extraction model still
needs a help from human hands. Along with rapid growth of technology, we
need a universal automatic system that works independently on any variant of
current image model. This research will apply the CBIR technique using images dissimilarity
measurements based on the theory of Normalized Compression Distance (NCD).
The main advantage of this method is, the absence of feature extraction within
CBIR can be applied in any kind of images. The NCD method used is the Simple
NCD and NCD Interleaving with compression tools by applying BZIP2
technique. The data being used are SIVAL data set and Corel data set. Trial on
Image Segmentation will be applied as data preparation in order to upgrade the
NCD competence. As a comparison, the data set will be also tested using CBIR
Octagon, so, the NCD competence can be compared with another CBIR tools. The results show that NCD method worked better on SIVAL Data set,
where the objects are located on different spatial. The utilizing of Image
Segmentation increase the NCD competence for almost 50% on SIVAL Data
set. However, the trials on mixture data set showed that NCD method had smaller
precision rather than CBIR Octagon, but the Image Segmentation also did not
show escalation.
