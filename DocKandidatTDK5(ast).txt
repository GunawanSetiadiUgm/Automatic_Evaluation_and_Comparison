Shopping on the internet has now become an alternative for consumers, but arising
the constraints regarding products that are not in accordance with the expectations of the customer. For
overcome it many online stores that provide policy returns are
free of charge. Due to the costs borne by the stores return online then the store must
predict the returns from customers who have made a purchase transaction.
With this prediction is expected to shop online can prepare solutions for
reduce Returns or for similar transactions did not occur later returns again.
K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm or the k-NN algorithm is one of the
classification data that produces powerful and effective if used in the data
which is great. By using the k-NN algorithm that implements method
classification based on learning object against, predictions can be searched
from similaritas number of nearest neighbors or the value of k. Process algorithms k-
NN on this research begins with the optimization of the parameters for selecting the value of k
optimal training phase, and the phase classification, and a number of nearby data k
taken to look for these labels.
Testing the system on this research can be done to get
prediction of returns to the past and the future. On testing system
This resulted in a return of value prediction k optimized for i.e. k = 21 with a value Fmeasure
amounting to 0.6427. Testing accuracy obtained for transaction data
the purchase of an online store in the year 2013 is of 58.94%.
