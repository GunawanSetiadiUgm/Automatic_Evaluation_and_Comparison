DOTA 2 is a multiplayer online game Battle Arena (MOBA). In DOTA 2, players consisting of 10 people are divided into two teams. Each player must choose one hero, the character to be played. Each hero has a unique ability, therefore the player must choose hero with consideration of hero who has or will be chosen by his team-mates. The composition of the hero in a team determines the magnitude of the chances for victory. How to play the team must also be adapted to the composition of the hero in the team to increase the chances of victory.
Genetic algorithm is an algorithm that adopts the behavior of living things, such as marriage and mutation, to solve a problem. Genetic algorithm is perfect for solving optimization problems. The resulting output quality depends on how to design a problem into the genetic algorithm well.
In this study, genetic algorithms are used to find optimal hero compositions based on the team's hero role and play style. The optimal condition in question is assessed by the quality of how the composition of the hero can meet the desired play style criteria and can be used in DOTA 2 games. The test results on Dota Picker show that 8 out of 10 hero compositions are produced in play style balance, 7 of 10 hero compositions which is generated in the late game play style, and 10 of the 10 hero compositions produced in the fast push play style meet the test criteria. Testing on DOTA 2 shows that 12 games tested can be won overall using the hero composition which is the most optimal result the system generates.
