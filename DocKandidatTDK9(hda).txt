Data center needs increased due to the development of the times
generate a lot of data. The construction of data centers require the use
infrastructure IP for connected. While the supply of IPv4 is already
thinning. The solution is to apply the new IP addressing systems. IPv6
latest IP addressing system is replacing IPv4. With the system
128-bit addressing makes IPv6 addressing can give much more
many compared to IPv4.
This research will be performed on IPv6 implementation in the virtual
the data center with Xenserver. Implementation using 6to4 tunneling method
that compared to the use of both IPv4 and IPv6 are pure and unadulterated. For
know its performance, conducted a test with parameters of throughput, jitter,
packet loss, and latency. In addition to other testing done by analyzing
packets that pass through the network.
The results of this research show that the ipv6 implementation on
virtual data center requires at least 4 pieces of virtual machine as
routers and hosts. Views of network performance, ipv6 scenarios throughput results
most pure high compared to other scenarios, with an average value of 2791.29
Mbit/s jitter Value. on IPv6 tunneling scenarios most high than two
other scenarios, with the average value of 0.0336 ms. different to the scenario of IPv6
tunneling, IPv4 and IPv6 scenarios pure pure packet does not occur at all
loss. However, the latency parameter for IPv6 tunneling scenarios have latency
most of the average value of 1,137 ms.
