The high number of motor vehicle theft makes security efforts always improved. One way that is often done is to install a surveillance camera or CCTV camera (closed circuit television). Furthermore, IP camera technology makes images from CCTV cameras visible online. But IP cameras still need the help of surveillance from humans. Therefore it takes a program that can help people keep an eye on static objects automatically.
Program is made using background subtraction algorithm as well as contour detection. The algorithm is applied simply, the background subtraction is used with the background model specified by the user, while the contour detection is used regardless of the hierarchy of the object obtained. After that, supervision is done by comparing each detected object on each frame. In the program there are variables that can be configured to assist in detecting objects and detecting lost objects.
After the program is created, it can be concluded that the program can monitor objects and can issue a warning when the object disappears. Different place conditions require different configuration variables, and there is no good variable value for all conditions in the conduct of surveillance. In addition, the program is made very sensitive to changes in light that exist, because the learning rate is worth 0. This makes the program is not suitable for use in places affected by lighting changes, such as day and night.
