The current technological development has been very rapid, one of which is a GPS that can determine the position of its users. But GPS hard work if in the closed room because the satellite signal not directly accepted by the catcher signals because certain objects is hindered by. Alternative determination of a location indoors, i.e. by making use of wifi and wireless positioning system called. The use of wifi as a determinant of the location has been researched, but certain factors because the fit is less accurate.
On this research will be used algrotima LVQ (Learning Vector Quantization) for positioning. LVQ algorithms require training data and data testing. Conducted a survey to obtain data for training and testing data, places data capture at a place called the Reference Point (RP). On the process of data capture, signal strength is not necessarily the same though it is at the same position. This research sought how to get reference point which gives good results to determine position using wifi signals. The data collected will be processed into position using the coordinate method of fingerprint. Fully tested on data retrieval from 1 RP that has little of the variation pattern of signal strength with 5 RP have more pattern variation signal strength.
The results obtained from this research is data from 5 USD the results not as good as the data from 1 USD, because too many variations in signal strength that generates the reference weights. In the end when done testing the detection number of results the right place target at 5 USD is not as much as RP 1.
