The development of technology today is very rapid, one of which is GPS that can determine the position of its users. However, GPS is difficult to work if the indoor is closed because the satellite signal is not directly received by the signal catcher because it is blocked by certain objects. Alternative location determination in the room already exists, namely by utilizing wifi and called the wireless positioning system. The use of wifi as a determinant of location has been much studied, but because certain factors accuracy is less accurate.
In this research will be used algrotima LVQ (Learning Vector Quantization) for positioning. LVQ algorithms require data training and data testing. Conducted surveys to get training data and data testing, places where data collection at a place called the Reference Point (RP). In the process of data retrieval, the strength of the signal obtained is not necessarily the same despite being in the same position. This research sought how to get reference point that give good result to determine position by using wifi signal. The collected data will be processed into position coordinates by using the fingerprint method. Tested on data retrieval of 1 RP which has a slight pattern of signal strength variations with 5 RPs that have more variation patterns of signal strength.
The results obtained from this research are data from 5 RP result is not as good as data from 1 RP, because too much variation of signal strength yielding less reference weight less good. In the end when testing the number of results of the correct spot detection target at 5 RP is not as much as 1 RP.
