DOTA 2 is a game-Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA). On DOTA 2, players are made up of 10 people divided into two teams. Each player must choose one hero, which will be played. Each hero has a unique ability, therefore the player must choose a hero with consideration of the hero already or will be selected by a teammate. The composition of the hero in a team largely determine the magnitude of the opportunity for a victory. How to play team should also be adapted to the composition of the team in the hero to enlarge the chance of victory.
The genetic algorithm is an algorithm which adopt the behavior of living things, such as marriage and mutation, to solve a problem. The genetic algorithm is suitable to solve optimization problems. The quality of the output produced depends on how to design a problem into genetic algorithm with good.
In this study, the genetic algorithm is used to find compositions based on optimal hero hero role and play style of the team. Optimal conditions is judged from the quality of how the composition of the hero can meet the criteria of the desired style of play and can be used in the game of DOTA 2. The results of testing on Dota Picker shows that 8 out of 10 compositions hero generated on play style balance, 7 out of 10 compositions hero generated on play style late-game, and 10 of 10 compositions hero generated on play style fast push meets the test criteria. Testing on DOTA 2 shows that the 12 matches to be tested can be won as a whole using the composition of the hero who is the most optimal results generated System.
