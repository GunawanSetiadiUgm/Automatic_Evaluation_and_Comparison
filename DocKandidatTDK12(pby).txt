Development of data from time to time led to the formation of a wide range of variations in the form of a structured data from to in the form of unstructured. The form of unstructured data in question here is the data that have a relationship that is not optimal. The form of the relation is not optimal it will affect processing for reporting, so it needed a solution to these problems that is able to solve by applying the concept of business intelligence. The reporting process is processed using this BI concepts can be used to determine the decision. In this case the business intelligence tools can be used as a tool to do the processing over data that has previously been stored in the data warehouse to be used as reference in the activity graph to see how it has been done as long as this is so then the best decisions can be taken based on the results of the processing of such data.
This research will conduct an analysis of the structure of the sample database and then offer it to be the form of a database that is ready to use as a source in the reporting process with a concept of BI. Parameter used is the speed of data processing with the BI tools and understanding of the information displayed on the report according to the BI survey results.
Based on the test results, has obtained a new database structure form is ready to use as a source on BI, then also generated pattern processing from the original database into the new database so that the data can be displayed in BI-based reporting. In addition the research results obtained are influence the size and structure of the database with respect to time processing business intelligence tool as well as an understanding of how large the user upon successful BI report displayed on the dashboard. Analysis of the research results that form the data source and initial forms of relation is very influential on the final report BI information.
