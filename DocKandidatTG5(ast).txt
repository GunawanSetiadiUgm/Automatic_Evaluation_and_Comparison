Shopping on the internet is now an alternative for consumers, but it arises
constraints on products that are not in line with customer expectations. For
overcome that many online stores that provide a policy of returns on a regular basis
free. Because the cost of return is borne by the online store then the store must
predict returns from customers who have made a purchase transaction.
With these predictions it is expected that online stores can prepare solutions for
reducing returns or for later similar transactions no longer returns.
The k-Nearest Neighbor or k-NN algorithm is one of the algorithms
a classification that produces powerful and effective data when used on data
the big one. Using the k-NN algorithm that applies the method
classification of objects based on learning data, predictions can be searched
of similarity to the number of nearest neighbors or k values. Process algorithm k-
NN in this study started with parameter optimization to select k value
the optimal, the training phase, then the classification phase, and the number of nearest data k
taken to search for the majority label.
System testing in this study can be done to get
prediction of return for the past and future. On system testing
this return prediction yields the most optimal k value k = 21 with the Fmeasure value
of 0.6427. Test accuracy obtained for transaction data
the purchase of an online store in 2013 amounted to 58.94%.
