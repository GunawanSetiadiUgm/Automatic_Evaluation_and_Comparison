Government policy to raise the price of fuel oil (BBM), especially premium in
recent months led to a variety of effects. Impact of a very influential one of which is
the rate of inflation. If the fuel price increases, the inflation rate will also increase.
Therefore, the government should be able to predict the rate of inflation based on the
increase in fuel prices. Of the prediction results obtained, the government will be able
to prepare fiscal policies and non-fiscal to face all the risks that will happen and
maintain economic stability in Indonesia.
Genetic algorithm is one of the great computational methods to predict. By using
a genetic algorithm that applies natural generation technique that is evolution, a
solution can be sought by promising computational model. The process of genetic
algorithms in this study starts from the generation of the initial population, the selection
of the parent with the roulette wheel selection, crossover process with whole arithmetic
crossover, random mutation process up to the selection of survivors in the form of
steady-state updates are done well to get a prediction solution.
Testing the system in this study can be predicted inflation rate for the past and
the future. In testing the predictions of inflation system found other factors besides the
price premium. Another factor is worth 3.83. With the reduction of other factors, the
test results predicted in the reign of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono during a 10-year
gained increased accuracy from 42.98% to 62.16%. Accuracy testing for prediction of
the month January 2015 by 87%. While testing accuracy for the prediction of the month
February 2015 amounted to 97%.
