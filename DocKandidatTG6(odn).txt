The need for computer usage is increasing with
the growing technological development. One of the tools of use
the computer is a thin-client. With thin-client, we are not required
spend a lot of money to be able to use the computer. Only with
simple devices and network connections, we can already use
computer. One device that can be used as a thin-client is
Raspberry Pi.
In this research used Slow-Motion Benchmarking method
calculates the performance of 2 pieces of thin-client operating system on the Raspberry platform
PI. The main parameter in this test is to give a pause or delay on
each operation performed so that all requested operations are acceptable
intact by thin-client after being processed by the server in the absence of that process
covered by other processes. This research involves 3 pieces of testing, that is
web page load text test performace, web page load performance, and
video playback performance.
From the test results obtained that the performance on each thinclient
has a significant difference. This is caused by
differences in the protocol model used, and the information processing model
graphics performed by each thin-client.
