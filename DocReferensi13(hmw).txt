Fantasy Premier League (FPL) is an official game organized by The
Football Association, the England football associations, as promotion of the
Premier League. FPL is played by selecting the 15 football players who play in the
Premier League on a weekly basis with certain rules, to maximize the points
according to their contribution to the actual game in the Premier League. In this
game, the manager of FPL tested their ability of analysis in determining the
players who are expected to reach the high points in every game.
Genetic algorithm is one method of soft computing are often used in
making projections. In this research, the genetic algorithm is used to project the
FPL player points, and then compared the accuracy with methods that already
exist. Fitness function used is the mean squared error of multiple linear
regression modeling. There are three factors that are modeled as linear
regression: the level of difficulty of the game, the average points of FPL player in
the last 30 days, and the average rating of FPL player in the last 30 days.
