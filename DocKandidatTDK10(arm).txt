Government policy to raise the price of Fuel (BBM)
especially the premium on the last few months led to a variety of impacts.
The impact of a very influential one was the level of inflation. If the price of fuel
increase, the inflation rate will also increase. Therefore,
the Government should be able to predict the inflation rate based on the increase in fuel prices.
Prediction of the results obtained, the Government will be able to prepare policies
fiscal and non-fiscal for dealing with any risks that will occur
and maintain the stability of economy in Indonesia.
Genetic algorithm is a computational method is one that is great for
perform predictions. Using genetic algorithm to apply
natural evolution i.e. generation techniques, solutions can be searched by a model of computation
promising. The process of genetic algorithms in the research starting stirring
the initial population, the selection of the parent with the selection process, a roulette wheel with crossover
whole arithmetic crossover, the process of random mutations until survivor selection form
steady state update done well to get the solution of prediction.
Testing the system on this research can be done prediction inflation rate
for the past and the future. On testing the system predicted inflation rate
found factors other than premium price. These other factors worth amounted to 3.83.
With the reduction of these other factors, testing the results of prediction at the time
the Government of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono for 10 years gained an increase
accuracy of 42.98% to 62.16%. Testing accuracy for predictions in January
2015 amounting to 87%. While the accuracy of predictive testing for February 2015
of 97%.
