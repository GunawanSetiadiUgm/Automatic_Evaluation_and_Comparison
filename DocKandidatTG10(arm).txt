Government policy to raise the price of Fuel Oil (BBM)
particularly the premium in recent months caused various impacts.
The impact is very influential one of them is the rate of inflation. If the price is fuel
increase, inflation rate will also increase. Therefore,
the government should be able to predict the inflation rate based on the fuel price hike.
From the results of predictions obtained, the government will be able to prepare policies
fiscal and non-fiscal to deal with any risks that will occur
and maintain the stability of the economy in Indonesia.
The genetic algorithm is one of the best computational methods for
make predictions. By using a genetic algorithm that implements
the nature generation technique that is evolution, the solution can be searched with the computation model
promising. The process of genetic algorithm in this study started from generation
initial population, parent selection with roulette wheel selection, crossover process with
whole arithmetic crossover, random mutation process up to survivor selection
steady state updates done well to get prediction solutions.
System testing in this study can be predicted inflation rate
for the past and the future. On testing the system predicted the inflation rate
found other factors besides the premium price. Another factor is worth 3.83.
With the reduction of these other factors, testing predicted results in the future
the government of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono for 10 years obtained an increase
accuracy from 42.98% to 62.16%. Test accuracy for January prediction
2015 by 87%. While testing accuracy for February 2015 prediction
by 97%.
