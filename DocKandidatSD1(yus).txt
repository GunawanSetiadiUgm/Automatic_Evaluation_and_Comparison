Content-based image retrieval ( cbir generally done by implementing extraction features to image data included. But extraction features will one the image format with the image format the other will be different so it human intervention that they are still needed to analyse model extraction who needed. With the rapid the development of the technology this, is required a automatic system universal so system can work independently to all models the image format at the present time. On this research , will be applied with cbir using the measurement of shots would take off and disimilaritas according to the theory of normalized compression distance ( ncd ). 
The main advantage this method is there did not appear to the extraction of most common feature of f in cbir so that it can be applied to all the main types of the image of. 
A method of ncd that is used on of this research is ncd simple and ncd interleaving with a tool compression uses the technique bzip2. 
The data used in research this time was dataset sival and dataset corel. 
Testing going to happen to image segmentation will be applied as a plaster preparation data with the aim of enhancing the ability of ncd. 
In comparison the similarly shaped tool used by will test and critically appraise dataset expel them from their houses tool cbir octagon report in order to know the ability of ncd if compared with the situation tool at p m other cbir. The result of this research showed that method ncd worked on better dataset sival where bogie is in a spatial location different. 
The use of image segmentation able to increase the ability almost 50 % the ability ncd in dataset sival structure. 
But on trial use dataset a combination of sival with corel ( of structures a mixture ) , ncd having precision smaller than the produced by tool cbir octagon, But image segmentation not give increased in performance precision ncd when worn in dataset structure a mixture.
