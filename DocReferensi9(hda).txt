The needs of data centers is increasing because of the ever increasing data.
The construction of data centers require use of IP infrastructure to be connected.
While the supply of IPv4 is already thinning. The solution is to apply the new IP
addressing systems. IPv6 is the newest IP addressing systems that replace IPv4.
With a 128-bit addressing system make the IPv6 addressing can give so much
more than IPv4.
In this research will be performed IPv6 implementation in virtual data
center with xenserver. Implementation using tunneling 6to4 methods were
compared to use of pure IPv4 and pure IPv6. To determine the performance, the
test performed with the parameters are throughput, jitter, packet loss, and latency.
In addition to other testing done by analyzing packets that pass through the
network.
The result of this research show that the IPv6 implementation on virtual
data center requires at least 4 pieces of virtual machine as a router and host. Views
of network performance, the results of throughput on pure IPv6 skenario is the
highest compared to the other skenario, with average value of 2791.29 Mbit/s.
Jitter value on Ipv6 tunneling skenario is the highest than two other skenario, with
average value of 0.0336 ms. Different to IPv6 tunneling skenario, skenario of pure
IPv6 and pure IPv4 there is no packet loss at all. However, for the latency
parameters, IPv6 tunneling skenario has greatest latency with an average value is
1.137 ms.
