Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) generally do
feature extraction by performing against the image data placed. 
However
extraction of feature will be a form's image with another image of the form will
different that human intervention is still required in analyzing
extraction of model is needed. 
With the rapid development of technology
Currently, it takes an automatic system that is universal so that
the system can work independently of all models of the shape of the image
There is at the moment. In this research, will be applied using CBIR measurement
image disimilaritas based on the theory of the Normalized Compression Distance (NCD). 
The main advantage of this method is the extraction of features not found in CBIR
so it can be applied on any type of image. 
NCD method used
in this research is a simple Interleaving NCD and NCD with tools
using the technique of compression is BZIP2. 
The data used in the study times
This is the dataset dataset SIVAL and Corel. 
Testing will be done to the
Image segmentation is applied as a data preparation with the aim of
improve the ability of the NCD.
By comparison will be tested anyway datasets
the tool can be known so that the Octagon CBIR ability NCD
compared to other CBIR tool. 
The results of this research show that NCD method works better
on the dataset object is at SIVAL where spatial locations are different. 
The use of Image Segmentation to increase the ability of almost
50% NCD ability on the dataset structure SIVAL.
But in the experiment
using the combined dataset between SIVAL with Corel (structure
mix), NCD has a precision smaller than that produced by the tool
CBIR Octagon, but Image Segmentation does not provide increased
on the performance of precision NCD when imposed on the structure of the dataset.
