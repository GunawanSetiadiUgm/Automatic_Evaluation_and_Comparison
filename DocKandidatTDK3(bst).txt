Nearest neighbor search algorithms have been known to seek the semblance of an object against another object so that its implementation is commonly used in the field of pattern recognition, data mining, image processing, and others. This algorithm in data structure optimized for k-dimensional tree. This is done by passing the object of a search that might not yield optimal results so as to speed up the search process.
Implementation of an algorithm that runs in parallel and distributed has been the object of research is very sought after in the last decade. This is done to handle large-scale data. One of the implementation model that was used in the handling of large data is MapReduce. However, a library that can be used for the purposes of using the data mining model is not yet widely available. One of them is the nearest neighbor search algorithm using k-dimensional tree.
In this study developed search algorithm nearest neighbors using the k-dimensional tree runs in parallel and distributed using MapReduce model. These programs run on top of Apache Hadoop framework. This research was conducted with test 1.7 million data point query against 2888, 4138, and 5439 cluster Centre spatial data objects in the form of GPS coordinate data as the taxi route training. It is run on a 1 to 5 machines. The result of this algorithm is able to walk around 400000 p on 5 machines.
