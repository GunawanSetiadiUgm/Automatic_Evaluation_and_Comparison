English used by the global community nowadays is a lingua franca, a connecting language for two parties with different mother tongues. As the mother tongue for more than 360 million people and foreign languages for over 600 million people, English requires a high quality Machine Translation (MT) in translating publications from other languages, including from Indonesian. There are several Indonesian — English MT that has been developed and could be accessed online, some of which are Google Translate and Tradukka.
To ensure that the MT has a high-quality translations, several methods of automatic evaluation by a computer are used. Three of the automatic evaluation methods used in this research are Match Accuracy (MAcc), Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU), and Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering (METEOR). Among those three methods, a comparison is performed to determine the best automatic evaluation method in evaluating MT. Comparisons are performed using Correlation value and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) value supported with the data from linguists.
This research evaluates the results of the both MT’s translation toward a predetermined reference text. Furthermore, the evaluation values obtained from BLEU, MAcc, and METEOR methods towards 150 sentences are compared using Correlation and MAPE calculations. The results gained indicated that BLEU method on unigram scope with MAPE mean value of 0.220563866 is the best automatic evaluation method compared to the MAcc and METEOR automatic evaluation method. Next results obtained shows that Google MT with a lower MAPE value, are better than Tradukka MT with the same value of BLEU mean.
