Now technology development is really fast, GPS is one of them that can determine user position. However GPS difficult to work in indoor location because sattelite signal not directly receive by its user. There is alternative way to determine location in indoor, which way is using wifi and its name is wireless positioning system (WPS). Wireless positioning system’s research have been widely studied, but because certain factor it’s has less accuration.
In this research using Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) algoritm for positioning. LVQ need data testing and data training. To get data training and testing survey is needed, place for collecting data called Reference Point (RP). In process of collecting data, signal strength not always same although in same position. In this research will look for how to get reference point that give a good result in wireless positioning system. Collected data will be process into position coordinat using fingerprint. Tested in data from 1 RP that have less signal strength variation pattern and data from 5 RP which have more signal strenght variation pattern.
The result obtained from this research is data from 5 RP are not as good as data from 1 RP because it is too much variation in signal strength that resulting not good reference weight. At last in testing appropriate detection with 5 RP not as much as 1 RP.
