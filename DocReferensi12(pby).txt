The development of data over time lead to the formation of a wide variety forms of data from structured to unstructured's form. Forms of unstructured data in question here are data that haven't optimal relationship. This type of forms will affect the processing for reporting, so the necessary solutions to solve the problem is to apply the concept of business intelligence. The reporting process is processed using BI concept that can be used to determine the decision. In this case the business intelligence tools can be used as a tool to carry out the processing of the data previously stored in the data warehouse to be used as reference in seeing how the chart’s activities that have been done so far so then the best decision can be taken based on the results of the data processing.
This study will carry out an analysis of the structure of the sample database and then process them in order to form a database that is ready to be used as source in the reporting process with the concept of BI. The parameters used are the speed of data processing with BI tools and understanding of the information displayed on BI report according to survey results.
Based on test results, this research has obtained form new database structure that is ready to be used as source in the BI, then also generated pattern database processing from the original form into the new database so that the data can be displayed in a BI-based reporting. In addition the results obtained is the effect of the size and structure of the database for processing time business intelligence tools as well as users' understanding of how big a successful BI report is displayed on the dashboard. Analysis of the research to get the result that the initial source of data forms and shapes their relationships are very influential in the final report of business intelligence information.
