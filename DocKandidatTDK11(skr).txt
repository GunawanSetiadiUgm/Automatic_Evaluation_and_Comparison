The technology of cloud computing or cloud computing has evolved and
trend of information technology in the business sector. The base of the cloud
computing is virtualization technology that is able to create a virtual version of the
operating systems, data storage or network resources. On a cloud
computing, if the virtual machine is created arbitrarily without regard to
the resources exist, it can cause the virtual data center not working
properly. Therefore the safety factor based on the design of the virtual configuration
machine on virtual data center infrastructure becomes important to note.
This test is done on the research of some virtual machine
with the allocation of resources, konfiguasi vCPU and different topology, which
diimplemntasikan on Xenserver 6.5. Research parameters used are
CPU usage and memory usage.
The results of this research indicate that the virtual data center
require high CPU and memory when it is first run. Based on
type of allocation of resources used virtual machine resource allocation
dynamically shows memory usage and CPU usage
stable. Based on the topology used by the virtual machine are obtained that
vitrual machine with 4vCPU and topology 1 socket with 4 core require
CPU usage is smaller when compared to the other.
