Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is generally done
by performing feature extraction against the included image data. However
feature extraction will be an image form with another image form will
different so that human intervention is still needed in analyzing
Extraction model required. With the rapid development of technology
nowadays, it needs an automatic system that is universal so
the system can work independently against all models of image form
there is this moment. In this research, CBIR will be applied using measurement
image disimilarity based on Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) theory.
The main advantage of this method is that there is no feature extraction in CBIR
so it can be applied to any type of image. NCD method used
in this research is NCD Simple and NCD Interleaving with tool
compression using BZIP2 technique. Data used in research times
these are SIVAL datasets and Corel datasets. Testing will be done against
Image segmentation will be applied as data preparation with purpose
improve NCD capability. For comparison we will also test the dataset
with the CBIR Octagon tool so it can know the ability of NCD
compared to other CBIR tools. The results of this study indicate that the NCD method works better
on the SIVAL dataset where the object is at a different spatial location.
The use of Image Segmentation can increase the ability almost
50% NCD capability on the SIVAL structure dataset. But in the experiment
using a combined dataset between SIVAL and Corel (structure
mixed), NCD has a precision smaller than that generated by the tool
CBIR Octagon, But Image Segmentation does not provide any improvements
on precision NCD performance when applied to mixed structure datasets.
