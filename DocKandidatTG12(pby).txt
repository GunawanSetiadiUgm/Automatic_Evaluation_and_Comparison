The development of data over time causes the formation of various forms of data from structured to unstructured. Unstructured data form is meant here is data that has a relationship that is not optimal. The form of non-optimal relations will affect the processing for reporting, so the solution is needed to solve the problem is by applying business intelligence concept. The process of reporting processed using the BI concept is what can be used to make decisions. In this case business intelligence tools can be used as a tool to perform processing of data previously stored in the data warehouse to be used as a reference in seeing how the activity charts that have been done so far then the best decision can be taken based on the results of data processing .
This research will analyze the sample database structure and then process it to become a form of database ready for use as source in process of reporting with BI concept. The parameters used are the speed of data processing with BI tools as well as the understanding of the information displayed on the BI report according to survey results.
Based on the results of the test, has obtained a new database structure that is ready to be used as a source in BI, then also generated the pattern of processing from the original database form into a new database so that data can be displayed in BI-based reporting. In addition, the results obtained are the influence of database size and structure on the processing time of the business intelligence tool and how much user understanding of the BI report successfully displayed on the dashboard. The research analysis found out that the initial data source form and the relation form very influenced the final information of BI report.
